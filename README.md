# Project Euler 
<https://projecteuler.net/about>

Project Euler problems are a fun and enlightening way to learn both math and programming languages. Publishing code or solutions destroys the purpose of PE, so this is limited to sharing basic mathematical or programming theory that can shed some light to the problems. I've linked some of the articles I have come across and listed problems they could be relevant for. They are mostly Wikipedia articles. 

Search for a problem number and see if you are lucky!
